Greetings, CachyOS enthusiasts!

We're excited to announce our second release of 2024! This update focuses primarily on maintenance, bringing essential kernel updates, a major glibc upgrade, and a streamlined Live ISO.

This release comes ahead of the highly anticipated Plasma 6 update, ensuring compatibility with its transition to QT6.

**Important Note:** Due to a bug in mesa 24 impacting GNOME on NVIDIA cards, we are currently unable to offer a GNOME ISO for this release.

**Highlights:**

* **refind:** Enhanced layout flexibility by moving from `/boot/efi` to `/boot`, supporting various filesystems and encryption options.
* **Live ISO:** Enjoy a cleaner and more synchronized Live ISO experience.
* **Launch Installer:** Benefit from a helpful recommendation for online installation.
* **shell-configs:** Customize your terminal experience with the option to disable fastfetch and utilize a new "update" alias.
* **netinstall:** KDE users rejoice with the addition of phonon-qt5-vlc.
* **Package Updates:** Stay up-to-date with the latest versions of linux-cachyos (6.7.6), mesa (24.0.1), gcc (13.2.1-12), glibc (2.39), and nvidia (550.54.14).
